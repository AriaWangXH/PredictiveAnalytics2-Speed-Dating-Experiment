# Predicting "Match" in a Speed Dating Experiment

For this project, the objective is to predict whether the participant successfully matches with a partner (yes or no) and identify the important predictors when it comes to a match. Our dataset (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment)) includes participant information related to demographics, dating habits, lifestyles, an attribute evaluation questionnaire taken when the participants sign up, ratings for their partners during the 4 minute interactions, and each participantâ€™s response on if they would like to match with the partner they met.
